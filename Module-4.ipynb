    "### What is LCEL?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A declarative way to build AI pipelines in LangChain.\n",
    "* Instead of long Python code, you connect components in a chain-like style.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LCEL?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shorter and cleaner code.\n",
    "* Easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "* Works the same for synchronous, asynchronous, batch, and streaming execution.\n",
    "* Good for debugging and reusing components.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Without LCEL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(\"Tell me a joke about {topic}\")\n",
    "chain = LLMChain(llm=ChatOpenAI(), prompt=prompt)\n",
    "result = chain.run(\"cats\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With LCEL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = prompt | ChatOpenAI() | StrOutputParser()\n",
    "result = chain.invoke({\"topic\": \"cats\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "**prompt, ChatOpenAI(), StrOutputParser() are called runnables**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## LCEL Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "* `|` → Pipe operator, connects steps.\n",
    "* `.invoke()` → Run once with input.\n",
    "* `.batch()` → Run for multiple inputs.\n",
    "* `.stream()` → Get outputs step by step (streaming responses).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Composable – you can plug and play different parts.\n",
    "2. Parallel and sequential execution supported.\n",
    "3. Unified API – works the same for sync, async, batch, and streaming.\n",
    "4. Production-ready – optimized for speed and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* LCEL is a short and readable way to connect LangChain components.\n",
    "* It works like piping data through different steps.\n",
    "* Use `|` to chain steps.\n",
    "* The same code works for real-time, async, or batch calls.\n",

Here are some training tips specifically geared towards Shepherds:\\n\\n**1.

Think puppy classes, walks in different environments, and meeting friendly, well-behaved dogs.\\n*   **Socialization window:**  The critical socialization period is between 8 and 16 weeks of age.  While it's ideal to start during this time, socialization is important throughout their life.\\n*   **Positive Reinforcement:**  Use treats, praise, and toys to reward positive interactions.  Never force an interaction if your dog is scared or uncomfortable.\\n\\n**2. Basic Obedience is Essential:**\\n\\n*   **Start with the basics:**  Sit, stay, come, down, leave it, and heel.  Use positive reinforcement methods.\\n*   **Consistency is crucial:**  Use the same commands and hand signals every time.  Practice in short, frequent sessions (5-10 minutes) several times a day\",\n",

Start Early and Be Consistent:**\\n\\n*   **Begin training as soon as possible.** Even if your dog is older, you can start right away.\\n*   **Consistency is key.** Use the same commands and hand signals every time. Everyone in the household should use the same cues.\\n*   **Keep training sessions short and frequent.** Focus on 5-10 minute sessions several times a day rather than one long, drawn-out session. This helps maintain your dog's focus.\\n\\n**2. Positive Reinforcement is Your Best Friend:**\\n\\n*   **Use treats, praise, and toys as rewards.**  Find what motivates your dog the most. High-value treats (small pieces of cheese, cooked meat, etc.) can be especially effective for challenging commands.\\n*   **Avoid punishment.** Punishment can create fear and anxiety, which can hinder learning and damage your bond with your dog.

Building Trust and Connection (The Foundation):**\\n\\n*   **Patience is Key:** Night Furies are wary of humans initially. Don't rush the process. Let your Night Fury come to you. Offer a hand outstretched, palm up, as a sign of peace.\\n*   **Positive Reinforcement, Always:** Night Furies respond best to positive reinforcement. Scolding or punishment will only damage your bond and make them distrustful.\\n*   **Understand Their Body Language:** Learn to read your Night Fury's body language. A relaxed posture, purring (yes, they purr!), and curious nudges are good signs. Flattened ears, hissing, and a tucked tail indicate fear or discomfort.\\n*   **Bonding Activities:** Spend time with your Night Fury doing things they enjoy. This could be flying, exploring, or simply relaxing together.\\n*   **Communicate Clearly:** Use a calm, soothing voice when interacting with your Night Fury\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'MAX_TOKENS', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run--3326ddf5-7004-4be3-933b-f3e24beb607d-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 20, 'output_tokens': 248, 'total_tokens': 268, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})]"
