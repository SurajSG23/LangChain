    "### What is LCEL?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A declarative way to build AI pipelines in LangChain.\n",
    "* Instead of long Python code, you connect components in a chain-like style.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LCEL?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shorter and cleaner code.\n",
    "* Easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "* Works the same for synchronous, asynchronous, batch, and streaming execution.\n",
    "* Good for debugging and reusing components.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Without LCEL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(\"Tell me a joke about {topic}\")\n",
    "chain = LLMChain(llm=ChatOpenAI(), prompt=prompt)\n",
    "result = chain.run(\"cats\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With LCEL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = prompt | ChatOpenAI() | StrOutputParser()\n",
    "result = chain.invoke({\"topic\": \"cats\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "**prompt, ChatOpenAI(), StrOutputParser() are called runnables**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## LCEL Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "* `|` → Pipe operator, connects steps.\n",
    "* `.invoke()` → Run once with input.\n",
    "* `.batch()` → Run for multiple inputs.\n",
    "* `.stream()` → Get outputs step by step (streaming responses).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Composable – you can plug and play different parts.\n",
    "2. Parallel and sequential execution supported.\n",
    "3. Unified API – works the same for sync, async, batch, and streaming.\n",
    "4. Production-ready – optimized for speed and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* LCEL is a short and readable way to connect LangChain components.\n",
    "* It works like piping data through different steps.\n",
    "* Use `|` to chain steps.\n",
    "* The same code works for real-time, async, or batch calls.\n",

This makes them quick learners, but also means they can get bored easily. Keep training sessions short, engaging, and varied.\\n*   **Herding Instinct:** Many Shepherds retain a strong herding instinct. This can manifest as nipping at heels, chasing cars, or rounding up children. Training should focus on redirecting this instinct into more appropriate behaviors.\\n*   **Protectiveness:** They are naturally protective of their family and territory. Early socialization is crucial to prevent over-protectiveness and aggression towards strangers or other animals.\\n*   **High Energy:** Shepherds need a lot of exercise and mental stimulation to thrive. A bored Shepherd can become destructive.\\n\\n**2. Focus on Positive Reinforcement:**\\n\\n*   **Reward-Based Training:** Use positive reinforcement like treats, praise, toys, or petting to reward desired behaviors.

Avoid yelling, which can be counterproductive.\\n*   **Be Patient:** Training takes time and patience. Don\\'t get discouraged by setbacks. Celebrate small victories.\\n*   **Mental Stimulation:** Shepherds are working dogs. They need mental challenges to prevent boredom and destructive behaviors. Puzzle toys, training games, and obedience exercises are great.\\n*   **Body Language:** Dogs communicate through body language. Be aware of your own posture and signals. Stand tall and confident.

Here are some tips tailored for training your Night Fury:\\n\\n**Understanding Your Night Fury:**\\n\\n*   **Empathy and Trust:** Night Furies are highly sensitive and bond deeply with their riders. Building trust is paramount. Spend time simply being near them, talking to them in a calm voice, and observing their behavior.\\n*   **Intelligence and Curiosity:** They are incredibly smart and get bored easily. Training sessions should be short, engaging, and filled with variety.\\n*   **Playfulness:** Night Furies love to play! Incorporate games into your training to keep them motivated and build a stronger bond.\\n*   **No Harshness:** Never use punishment or force. This will destroy their trust and make training impossible. Positive reinforcement is key.\\n*   **Individual Personality:** Remember that each dragon, even within the same species, has their own unique personality. Tailor your training to your dragon's specific quirks and preferences.\\n\\n**Training Techniques:**\\n\\n1.  **Start with Basic Commands (Hand Signals & Vocal Cues):**\\n\\n    *   **Come:** Use a distinct whistle or\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'MAX_TOKENS', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run--0e4a0080-2b4f-449d-9c6b-8f1cbf1277df-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 20, 'output_tokens': 249, 'total_tokens': 269, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})]"
