    "### What is LCEL?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A declarative way to build AI pipelines in LangChain.\n",
    "* Instead of long Python code, you connect components in a chain-like style.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LCEL?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shorter and cleaner code.\n",
    "* Easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "* Works the same for synchronous, asynchronous, batch, and streaming execution.\n",
    "* Good for debugging and reusing components.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Without LCEL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(\"Tell me a joke about {topic}\")\n",
    "chain = LLMChain(llm=ChatOpenAI(), prompt=prompt)\n",
    "result = chain.run(\"cats\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With LCEL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = prompt | ChatOpenAI() | StrOutputParser()\n",
    "result = chain.invoke({\"topic\": \"cats\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "**prompt, ChatOpenAI(), StrOutputParser() are called runnables**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## LCEL Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "* `|` → Pipe operator, connects steps.\n",
    "* `.invoke()` → Run once with input.\n",
    "* `.batch()` → Run for multiple inputs.\n",
    "* `.stream()` → Get outputs step by step (streaming responses).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Composable – you can plug and play different parts.\n",
    "2. Parallel and sequential execution supported.\n",
    "3. Unified API – works the same for sync, async, batch, and streaming.\n",
    "4. Production-ready – optimized for speed and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* LCEL is a short and readable way to connect LangChain components.\n",
    "* It works like piping data through different steps.\n",
    "* Use `|` to chain steps.\n",
    "* The same code works for real-time, async, or batch calls.\n",

Here are some training tips specifically geared towards Shepherds:\\n\\n**1. Early Socialization is Key:**\\n\\n*   **Expose your Shepherd to a variety of sights, sounds, people, and other dogs.**  Do this in a controlled and positive manner.  Think puppy classes, walks in different environments, and meeting friendly, well-behaved dogs.\\n*   **Socialization window:**  The critical socialization period is between 8 and 16 weeks of age.  While it's ideal to start during this time, socialization is important throughout their life.\\n*   **Positive Reinforcement:**  Use treats, praise, and toys to reward positive interactions.  Never force an interaction if your dog is scared or uncomfortable.\\n\\n**2. Basic Obedience is Essential:**\\n\\n*   **Start with the basics:**  Sit, stay, come, down, leave it, and heel.  Use positive reinforcement methods.\\n*   **Consistency is crucial:**  Use the same commands and hand signals every time.  Practice in short, frequent sessions (5-10 minutes) several times a day\",\n",

Use praise, gentle scratches (especially under the chin!), and rewards (see \"Food Rewards\" below) when they do something right.\\n*   **Understanding Body Language:** Learn to read your Night Fury\\'s body language.  A relaxed posture, soft eyes, and purring indicate comfort and trust.  Pinning ears, dilated pupils, and hissing are signs of fear or discomfort.
