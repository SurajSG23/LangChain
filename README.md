# LangChain

LangChain is a framework designed to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides tools that make it easier to connect models with external data, memory, and reasoning capabilities.

## Key Features

### 1. Stateful Applications

* LangChain allows applications to keep **memory** of past interactions.
* Instead of treating every request as new, it can remember previous steps or conversations.
* Useful for chatbots, assistants, and agents that need long-term context.

### 2. Context-Aware Applications

* LangChain helps integrate **external knowledge sources** like databases, APIs, or documents.
* This allows models to give answers that are grounded in real data rather than relying only on what they were trained on.
* Example: answering questions about your company’s documents or product catalog.

### 3. Reasoning and Decision-Making

* LangChain supports **chains** (sequences of steps) and **agents** (models that can choose tools).
* These let models break down complex tasks into smaller steps, make decisions, and call external tools or APIs when needed.
* Example: planning a workflow, summarizing a report, or running a multi-step query.

## Typical Use Cases

* Question answering systems
* Conversational agents
* Document summarization and analysis
* Code generation and debugging assistants
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines

## Components

* **Chains:** Link multiple calls or steps together.
* **Agents:** Let the model decide which action to take next.
* **Memory:** Store context from earlier steps or conversations.
* **Tools and Connectors:** Integrate with APIs, databases, search engines, and file systems.

## Why LangChain?

* Makes LLM applications more **powerful and practical**.
* Handles the challenges of **context management**, **reasoning**, and **integration with external systems**.
* Designed to be flexible and modular, so you can build small prototypes or production-scale systems.

## LangSmith

**LangSmith** is a platform built by the LangChain team to help you **debug, test, and monitor** applications powered by LLMs.

### What it does:

* **Tracing:** Tracks each step your application takes (inputs, outputs, intermediate calls).
* **Evaluation:** Lets you run experiments and measure performance of your chains and agents.
* **Collaboration:** Share traces and results with your team for debugging.
* **Monitoring:** Keep an eye on your application when it’s running in production.

## LangServe

**LangServe** is a toolkit to help you **deploy LangChain applications as APIs**.

### What it does:

* Wraps your chain or agent in a **REST API** automatically.
* Lets you serve your model endpoints so other services or applications can use them.
* Built on **FastAPI**, so it’s fast and production-ready.
* Includes features like streaming responses and standardized endpoints.

## How They Fit Together

* **LangChain**: Framework to build LLM applications (chains, agents, memory).
* **LangSmith**: Debugging, testing, monitoring platform for LangChain apps.
* **LangServe**: Deployment toolkit to turn your LangChain app into an API.
